			a dumb minecraft server that macimas and iogame made in very early 2021, initially called <a>.io</a>
			was used as a pvp and an smp server, but went inactive for a while when macimas started bitter!mc

			it was revived as an smp sometime in mid 2021 but never had more than 3 players
			(iogame rarely played)

			then after 1.5 years, in late may 2023 macimas and iogame had talk of hosting an smp server
			in may 27, it was revived once more as an smp, rebranded as <a>.iogamer</a>
